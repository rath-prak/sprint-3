3.0 Redesign Your Site - 1.5 hours

What is your site's primary purpose?
To record my web development journey with Dev Academy so other people can follow and get an insight into what the EDA experience is about. Also to put into practice the skill and knowledge I have learnt so far by building a real website. 

Who is your target audience?
Friends, family, anyone who is interested in web development, industry professional and potential employers.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like 
them to have?
I would like site to have a spiritual and inspiring feel, where all the information is easily accessible. The blog section to be on one page in chronological order so the reader can follow my progress.  

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
  - Beautiful imagery for background.
  - Buttons that changes state when you click or hover with mouse.
  - Colours that evoke creativity and success, maybe magenta or orange
